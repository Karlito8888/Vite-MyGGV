# Mobile Picker Integration Specification

## Purpose
Replace standard HTML select dropdowns with react-mobile-picker components for enhanced mobile user experience in the onboarding flow.

## Requirements

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Mobile Picker Component Integration
The system SHALL integrate react-mobile-picker for block and lot selection in the Onboarding component.

#### Scenario: Block selection with mobile picker
- **WHEN** a user interacts with the block selection field
- **THEN** the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized picker interface
- **AND** the picker SHALL show all available block options
- **AND** the user SHALL be able to scroll and select blocks using touch gestures
- **AND** the selected value SHALL be properly integrated with react-hook-form

#### Scenario: Lot selection with mobile picker
- **WHEN** a user has selected a block and interacts with the lot selection field

- **AND** the picker SHALL show available lots for the selected block
- **AND** the picker SHALL be disabled or show placeholder when no block is selected
- **AND** the lot picker SHALL reset when block selection changes

#### Scenario: Picker data loading states
- **WHEN** block or lot data is being fetched
- **THEN** the picker SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
- **AND** the picker SHALL show placeholder text during data fetch
- **AND** the picker SHALL be interactive once data is loaded

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Form Validation with Pickers
The existing form validation requirements SHALL be updated to work with picker components.

#### Scenario: Picker value validation
- **WHEN** validating the onboarding form
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate picker-selected values
- **AND** validation errors SHALL be displayed appropriately for picker fields
- **AND** error handling SHALL be consistent with existing form validation patterns

#### Scenario: Required field validation
- **WHEN** a user submits the form without selecting block or lot values
- **THEN** the system SHALL display validation errors for the picker fields
- **AND** the picker fields SHALL be highlighted as invalid
- **AND** error messages SHALL be clearly visible to the user

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Responsive Picker Behavior
The picker components SHALL provide appropriate behavior for different device types.

#### Scenario: Mobile device interaction
- **WHEN** accessed on a mobile device
- **THEN** the picker SHALL provide native mobile picker experience
- **AND** touch interactions SHALL be smooth and responsive
- **AND** the picker SHALL be optimized for mobile screen sizes

#### Scenario: Desktop fallback
- **WHEN** accessed on a desktop device
- **THEN** the picker SHALL provide appropriate desktop interaction
- **AND** mouse interactions SHALL be properly handled
- **AND** the picker SHALL maintain usability across device types

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Data Flow Integration
The existing data flow requirements SHALL be updated to work with picker value changes.

#### Scenario: Picker value changes
- **WHEN** a user selects a value in the picker
- **THEN** the system SHALL update the form state immediately
- **AND** dependent fields SHALL react to value changes (e.g., lots loading when block changes)
- **AND** the form SHALL maintain proper validation state

#### Scenario: Form submission with picker values
- **WHEN** submitting the onboarding form
- **THEN** the system SHALL include picker-selected values in the submission
- **AND** the data format SHALL be consistent with existing backend expectations
- **AND** the submission process SHALL remain unchanged

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Picker Styling Integration
The picker components SHALL be styled to match the existing application design.

#### Scenario: Visual consistency
- **WHEN** displaying pickers in the onboarding form
- **THEN** the picker styling SHALL match the existing form element styles
- **AND** colors, typography, and spacing SHALL be consistent
- **AND** the picker SHALL integrate seamlessly with the form layout

#### Scenario: Error state styling
- **WHEN** picker fields have validation errors
- **THEN** the picker SHALL display error styling consistently with other form fields
- **AND** error indicators SHALL be clearly visible
- **AND** the error appearance SHALL match existing error state patterns

## Cross-Reference Requirements

This specification modifies and extends the following existing requirements:
- **Location Information Collection** from `openspec/specs/onboarding-flow/spec.md` - Updates the implementation method while maintaining the same validation and data collection requirements
- **Form Validation** patterns from existing onboarding implementation - Ensures consistency with current validation approach
- **Responsive Design** requirements from `openspec/specs/responsive-design/spec.md` - Maintains mobile-first approach while enhancing mobile interaction patterns
