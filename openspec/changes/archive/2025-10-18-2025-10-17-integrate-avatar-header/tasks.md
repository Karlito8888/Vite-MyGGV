## Dependencies and Notes

### Parallel Work Items
- CSS positioning can be developed alongside JavaScript transitions
- Avatar component integration can be tested independently

### Critical Dependencies
- Must have working authentication context
- Avatar component must be properly functioning
- Header layout must remain stable

### Risk Mitigation
- Backup existing files before modifications
- Test each component independently before integration
- Monitor performance impact during development
- Ensure fallbacks for missing user data

### Validation Criteria
- Avatar appears correctly for authenticated users
- Transitions are smooth and JavaScript-only
- Existing header functionality is preserved
- Responsive design works across all viewports
- Accessibility standards are met
- Performance impact is minimal
