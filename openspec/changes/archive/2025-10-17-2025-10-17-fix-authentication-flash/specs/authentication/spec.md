## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: User Authentication State
The system SHALL provide user authentication state management through Supabase authentication using email/password credentials with smooth transitions and no visual flashes.

#### Scenario: User login with email and password
- **WHEN** a user provides valid email and password
- **THEN** the system SHALL authenticate the user using signInWithPassword
- **AND** provide user state to components without visual flashes
- **AND** redirect to appropriate page based on onboarding status seamlessly
- **AND** display loading states during authentication processing

#### Scenario: Authentication state transitions
- **WHEN** authentication state changes (login/logout)
- **THEN** the system SHALL maintain loading states during transition
- **AND** prevent intermediate UI flashes
- **AND** ensure smooth visual transitions between auth states

#### Scenario: OAuth authentication flow
- **WHEN** a user authenticates via OAuth provider
- **THEN** the system SHALL handle callback without showing login page flash
- **AND** maintain loading state during OAuth processing
- **AND** redirect to appropriate destination after successful auth

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Authentication Loading States
The system SHALL provide consistent loading states during all authentication operations to prevent visual discontinuities.

#### Scenario: Authentication in progress
- **WHEN** any authentication operation is in progress
- **THEN** the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicator
- **AND** prevent navigation away from current view
- **AND** maintain UI stability until operation completes

#### Scenario: Authentication verification
- **WHEN** verifying authentication state or onboarding status
- **THEN** the system SHALL show loading state
- **AND** prevent route changes during verification
- **AND** only redirect after verification is complete

### Requirement: Seamless Route Transitions
The system SHALL handle route transitions during authentication without visual artifacts.

#### Scenario: Post-authentication redirect
- **WHEN** user successfully authenticates
- **THEN** the system SHALL redirect directly to destination page
- **AND** bypass intermediate login page display
- **AND** maintain loading state during redirect

#### Scenario: Protected route access
- **WHEN** accessing protected routes during auth state changes
- **THEN** the system SHALL handle transitions smoothly
- **AND** prevent flashing between login and protected content
- **AND** show appropriate loading states
