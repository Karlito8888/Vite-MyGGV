## Why
The current sidebar implementation uses CSS animations for opening/closing and doesn't close when navigation links are clicked, leading to a suboptimal user experience where users must manually close the sidebar after navigation.

## What Changes
- Replace CSS animations with JavaScript-controlled animations for smoother, more consistent behavior
- Add automatic sidebar closure when navigation links are clicked
- Remove unnecessary CSS animation code
- Improve animation timing and easing for better user experience
- Maintain accessibility and responsive design

## Impact
- Affected specs: sidebar-navigation
- Affected code: src/components/Sidebar.jsx, src/components/Navigation.jsx, src/styles/Sidebar.css
- User experience improvement with more intuitive navigation flow
- Cleaner codebase with JavaScript-controlled animations
