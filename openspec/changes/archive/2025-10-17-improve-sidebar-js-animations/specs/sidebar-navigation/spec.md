## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Collapsible Sidebar
The application SHALL provide a collapsible sidebar that slides in from the left side of the screen when the hamburger button is clicked using JavaScript-controlled animations.

#### Scenario:
When I click the hamburger button, I want a sidebar to slide in smoothly from the left side of the screen using JavaScript animations so that I can see all navigation options with consistent timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Sidebar slides in smoothly using JavaScript-controlled transforms
- Sidebar animation timing is consistent (300ms duration)
- Sidebar contains the existing Navigation component
- Sidebar has a close button (X) in the top-right corner
- Sidebar width is appropriate for mobile devices (280-300px)
- Sidebar has proper z-index to appear above content
- No CSS animations are used for sidebar movement

### Requirement: Backdrop Overlay
The application SHALL provide a backdrop overlay when the sidebar is open using JavaScript-controlled animations for consistent behavior.

#### Scenario:
When the sidebar is open, I want the main content to be dimmed with an overlay using JavaScript animations so that I can focus on the navigation with smooth transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Dark overlay appears when sidebar is open using JavaScript fade-in
- Overlay covers entire viewport
- Clicking overlay closes the sidebar
- Overlay has semi-transparent background
- Overlay prevents interaction with main content
- Overlay animation timing matches sidebar animation (300ms)

### Requirement: Close Functionality
The application SHALL provide multiple ways to close the sidebar including automatic closure when navigation links are clicked.

#### Scenario:
When I want to close the sidebar, I want multiple ways to do it including clicking navigation links so that I can easily return to the main content after navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Clicking close button (X) closes sidebar with JavaScript animation
- Clicking overlay backdrop closes sidebar with JavaScript animation
- Pressing Escape key closes sidebar with JavaScript animation
- Clicking any navigation link closes sidebar with JavaScript animation
- Sidebar slides out smoothly to the left using JavaScript transforms
- State is properly managed to prevent memory leaks
- All close methods use consistent animation timing (300ms)

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Navigation Link Auto-Close
The application SHALL automatically close the sidebar when any navigation link is clicked to improve user experience.

#### Scenario:
When I click on any navigation link in the sidebar, I want the sidebar to automatically close so that I can immediately see the content I navigated to without manual sidebar closure.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- All internal navigation links trigger sidebar closure on click
- External links (like GPS) also trigger sidebar closure on click
- Sidebar closure animation is smooth and consistent
- Navigation functionality remains unchanged
- Auto-close works for both internal and external links
- Sidebar closes before or during page navigation
