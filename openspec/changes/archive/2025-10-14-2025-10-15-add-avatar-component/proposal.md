# Add Avatar Component

## Summary
Create a reusable Avatar component that can be used throughout the project, starting with integration in the Profile page. The component will handle user profile images with fallback support and consistent styling.

## Problem
Currently, avatar display logic is embedded directly in the Profile page (lines 185-192), making it difficult to reuse avatars in other parts of the application like headers, comments, user lists, etc.

## Why
The current inline avatar implementation creates code duplication and inconsistency. As the application grows and needs avatars in more places (headers, user lists, comments, chat), we need a standardized, reusable component that ensures consistent behavior, styling, and accessibility across all avatar use cases.

## Solution
Create a reusable Avatar component that:
- Displays user profile images with fallback handling
- Supports different sizes (small, medium, large)
- Provides consistent styling across the application
- Can be easily imported and used anywhere

## Impact
- Improves code reusability and maintainability
- Enables consistent avatar display across the application
- Reduces code duplication
- Makes it easy to add avatars to new features

## Scope
- Create new Avatar component in src/components/
- Update Profile page to use the new Avatar component
- Add CSS styling for the Avatar component
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
