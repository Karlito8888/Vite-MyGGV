# Implementation Tasks

1. **Fix import statement in Login.jsx**
   - [x] Change `import { useAuth } from '../utils/AuthContext'` 
   - [x] To `import { useAuth } from '../utils/useAuth'`
   - [x] Verify the import resolves correctly

2. **Test authentication flow**
   - [x] Verify Login component loads without errors
   - [x] Confirm social login buttons are functional
   - [x] Test redirect to onboarding after successful login

3. **Validate no other files have similar import issues**
   - [x] Search for other incorrect useAuth imports
   - [x] Fix any additional instances found (Home.jsx also fixed)
