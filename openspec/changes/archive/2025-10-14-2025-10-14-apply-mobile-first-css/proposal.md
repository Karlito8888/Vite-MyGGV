# Apply Mobile-First CSS Policy

## Summary
Enforce mobile-first responsive design across all CSS files to ensure optimal user experience on mobile devices, particularly for the Philippine audience where mobile usage is predominant.

## Why
The Philippine audience predominantly uses mobile devices for internet access. Current CSS files have inconsistent mobile-first approaches:
- Some files use desktop-first media queries (`max-width`)
- Inconsistent breakpoint handling across components
- Missing mobile-specific optimizations
- Touch interaction improvements are incomplete
- Performance issues on slower mobile connections

## What Changes
Standardize all CSS files to follow mobile-first principles:
1. Base styles target mobile devices (320px+)
2. Progressive enhancement for larger screens using `min-width`
3. Consistent breakpoint system (481px, 769px, 1025px)
4. Touch-friendly interactions with 48px minimum targets
5. Mobile performance optimizations

## Scope
- All CSS files in `src/styles/`
- Responsive breakpoints and media queries
- Touch interaction optimizations
- Mobile-specific UI adjustments

## Benefits
- Better mobile user experience for Philippine users
- Faster page loads on mobile devices
- Consistent responsive behavior across all components
- Improved accessibility with proper touch targets
- Better performance on slower connections
- Reduced CSS complexity for mobile devices

## Implementation Strategy
1. Audit existing CSS files for mobile-first compliance
2. Standardize breakpoint system across all files
3. Update media queries to use `min-width` approach
4. Add mobile-specific optimizations
5. Ensure touch-friendly interactions with proper target sizes
