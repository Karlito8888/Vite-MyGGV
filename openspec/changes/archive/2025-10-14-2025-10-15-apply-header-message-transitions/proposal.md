# Apply Smooth Header Message Transitions

## Summary
Add smooth and modern transitions when header messages change, improving user experience with elegant fade and slide animations.

## Why
The current header message rotation creates a jarring user experience with abrupt text changes every 4 seconds. This detracts from the professional feel of the PWA and can be visually disruptive, especially on mobile devices where smooth interactions are expected. Modern web applications should provide polished micro-interactions that enhance usability without compromising performance or accessibility.

## Problem
Current header messages change abruptly every 4 seconds without smooth transitions, which can feel jarring to users.

## Solution
Implement CSS transitions and React state management to create smooth fade-out/fade-in animations between message changes.

## Impact
- Enhanced user experience with professional transitions
- Maintained accessibility with reduced motion support
- Minimal performance impact
- Consistent with mobile-first design principles

## What Changes
- **Header.jsx**: Add transition state management with fade-out/fade-in states
- **Header.css**: Implement smooth CSS transitions and animations
- **Accessibility**: Ensure reduced motion support for accessibility compliance

## Scope
- Modify Header.jsx to handle transition states
- Update Header.css with modern transition animations
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Maintain existing 4-second rotation timing
