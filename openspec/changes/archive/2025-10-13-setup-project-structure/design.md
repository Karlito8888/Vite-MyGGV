## Context
Setting up a non-professional PWA project for Philippine audience using Vite.js, React, Supabase stack with Archon MCP server integration for project management.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: Establish complete project foundation, integrate Archon for task management, set up knowledge base research workflow
- Non-Goals: Complex architecture, over-engineering, TypeScript usage, Tailwind CSS

## Decisions
- Decision: Use Archon MCP server as primary task and project management system
- Reason: Provides structured workflow, knowledge base integration, and project tracking
- Decision: Follow project.md constraints strictly (no TypeScript, no Tailwind, simple stack)
- Reason: Maintains project simplicity and non-professional scope

## Technical Stack Integration
- Vite.js: Build tool and development server with PWA plugin
- React with JSX: Frontend framework (no TypeScript)
- Supabase: Backend with database, auth, and RLS
- Zustand: State management only if necessary
- Archon MCP: Project and task management

## Architecture Patterns
- Simple CRUD using Supabase SDK
- Protected routing: Login → Onboarding → Home (protected)
- Fixed layout: Header, Main (Outlet), Footer
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Risks / Trade-offs
- Risk: Over-reliance on Archon for simple project → Mitigation: Keep Archon usage lightweight
- Trade-off: No TypeScript vs development speed → Accept reduced type safety for simplicity
- Risk: Supabase complexity → Mitigation: Use basic SDK patterns only

## Migration Plan
1. Create Archon project structure
2. Research documentation using knowledge base
3. Set up Vite.js project foundation
4. Integrate Supabase and authentication
5. Implement routing and layout
6. Establish development workflow

## Open Questions
- Specific authentication flow requirements for Philippine users?
- Content localization needs beyond English?
- Specific PWA features required beyond basic installability?
