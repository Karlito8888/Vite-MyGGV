## Why
The project has accumulated CSS files that may contain unused styles, increasing bundle size and maintenance overhead. Cleaning up unused CSS will improve performance and maintainability.

## What Changes
- Analyze all CSS files in src/styles/ to identify unused rules
- Remove unused CSS classes, properties, and media queries
- Ensure all remaining CSS is actively used by components
- Maintain responsive design requirements per existing specs
- Update any component imports if CSS files are removed

## Impact
- Affected specs: responsive-design (potential MODIFIED requirements for CSS optimization)
- Affected code: All CSS files in src/styles/, potentially component imports
- Performance: Reduced CSS bundle size
- Maintenance: Cleaner, more maintainable stylesheets
