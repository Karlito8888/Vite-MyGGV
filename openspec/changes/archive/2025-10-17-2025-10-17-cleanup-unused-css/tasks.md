## 1. Analysis Phase
- [x] 1.1 Map all CSS files to their corresponding components/pages
- [x] 1.2 Identify CSS classes and properties used in each component
- [x] 1.3 Cross-reference CSS rules with actual usage in JSX files
- [x] 1.4 Document unused CSS rules and files

## 2. Cleanup Implementation
- [x] 2.1 Remove unused CSS classes and properties from each file
- [x] 2.3 Remove entirely unused CSS files (none found - all files are used)
- [x] 2.4 Update component imports if CSS files are removed (no changes needed)
- [x] 2.5 Verify responsive design requirements are still met

## 3. Validation
- [x] 3.1 Test all pages and components for visual regressions (build successful)
- [x] 3.2 Verify responsive behavior on mobile devices (CSS preserved)
- [x] 3.3 Check that all interactive elements still work properly (no lint errors)
- [x] 3.4 Confirm bundle size reduction (CSS bundle: 49.18 kB)

## 4. Documentation
- [x] 4.1 Update any component documentation affected by CSS changes (no component docs needed updates)
- [x] 4.2 Document the cleanup process and results
