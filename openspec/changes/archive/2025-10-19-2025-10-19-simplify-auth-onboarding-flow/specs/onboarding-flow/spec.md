# Onboarding Flow System

## Purpose
Implement a conditional onboarding flow that checks user completion status after login and routes users appropriately.

## Requirements

## REMOVED

### Requirement: Complex Caching System
The complex caching system for onboarding status is REMOVED.

#### Rationale
Onboarding status changes at most once per user and does not require complex caching mechanisms.

### Requirement: Real-time Redirect Listeners
The real-time redirect listener system is REMOVED.

#### Rationale
Simple notifications do not require real-time database subscriptions for a one-time event.

### Requirement: Separate Redirect Hook
The useOnboardingRedirect hook is REMOVED.

#### Rationale
ProtectedRoute can handle all necessary redirects without requiring a separate hook.

## MODIFIED

### Requirement: Basic Onboarding Notification
The onboarding page SHALL provide a simple success notification without real-time complexity.

#### Scenario: Onboarding completion notification
- **WHEN** a user completes onboarding successfully
- **THEN** the system SHALL show a basic success message
- **AND** not use real-time listeners or complex redirect handling
- **AND** allow the user to navigate to the home page

#### Scenario: Simple user feedback
- **WHEN** onboarding is completed
- **THEN** a simple alert or inline message SHALL be displayed
- **AND** no Supabase real-time channels SHALL be created
- **AND** no redirect flags SHALL be set in the database
