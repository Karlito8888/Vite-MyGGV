# Remove Email/Password Authentication

## Why
Simplify authentication by removing email/password complexity while maintaining security through social OAuth providers. This reduces maintenance overhead, eliminates password-related security risks, and provides a streamlined user experience with fewer authentication options.

## What Changes
Remove all email/password authentication methods and UI components while preserving social OAuth authentication functionality.

## Summary
Remove email/password authentication functionality including sign up, sign in, password reset, and email confirmation flows. Keep only social authentication (Google, Facebook) for a simpler, more secure authentication experience.

## Scope
**BREAKING**: Removes all email/password authentication methods

### Files to Modify
- `src/pages/Login.jsx` - Remove email form, keep only social buttons
- `src/utils/AuthContext.jsx` - Remove email auth methods, keep only social auth

### Features Removed

- Authentication state management
- Protected routing system
- Claims-based authentication verification

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Simplified login process with fewer options
- **Security**: Reduced attack surface (no password-related vulnerabilities)
- **Maintenance**: Less code to maintain and secure
- **Database**: No changes needed to existing user data

## Dependencies
- Requires Supabase OAuth providers to be properly configured
