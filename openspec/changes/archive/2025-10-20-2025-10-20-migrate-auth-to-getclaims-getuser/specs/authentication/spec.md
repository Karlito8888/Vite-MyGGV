# Authentication Migration Implementation

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Authentication Helper Utilities
Helper utilities SHALL be created to abstract claims extraction and provide compatibility during migration.
#### Scenario:
When multiple components need similar authentication patterns, provide helper functions to abstract claims extraction.

#### Scenario:
When components need user metadata not in claims, provide utility to safely call getUser() with proper error handling.

## Cross-Reference Capabilities

- **User Profile Management**: Components displaying user profiles need updated data extraction from claims
- **Protected Routing**: All protected route components need migration to claims-based authentication
- **Navigation State**: Navigation components need claims-based authentication state checking
- **Data Preloading**: Hooks that preload user data need to use claims for authentication verification
