# Integrate HamburgerButton in Footer with Sidebar Coordination

## Summary
Ensure proper integration of the HamburgerButton component within the Footer component and establish correct coordination logic with the Sidebar component, while maintaining consistency with the global styles in index.css.

## Why
The current integration exists but needs verification and enhancement to ensure proper state management, CSS coordination, and mobile responsiveness. This integration is critical for the mobile navigation experience and must work seamlessly with the existing theme system and accessibility features.

## What Changes
- Verify Footer.jsx properly passes onMenuToggle and isSidebarOpen props to HamburgerButton
- Ensure Layout.jsx state management flows correctly between components
- Validate CSS coordination using global variables from index.css
- Test accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, touch targets)
- Confirm mobile responsiveness and smooth transitions

## Current State Analysis
- HamburgerButton component exists and is functional
- Footer component already imports and uses HamburgerButton
- Sidebar component has proper open/close logic with overlay and escape key handling
- Global styles in index.css include sidebar variables and overlay styles

## Problem Statement
The integration needs verification and potential improvements to ensure:
1. Proper state management between Footer/HamburgerButton and Sidebar
2. Consistent styling with global CSS variables
3. Proper accessibility and mobile-first responsive behavior
4. Smooth transitions and user experience

## Proposed Solution
1. Verify and enhance the current Footer-HamburgerButton integration
2. Ensure proper state flow: Footer → HamburgerButton → Sidebar
3. Validate CSS coordination between component styles and global variables
4. Test mobile responsiveness and accessibility features

## Scope
- Components: Footer.jsx, HamburgerButton.jsx, Sidebar.jsx
- Styles: Footer.css, HamburgerButton.css, Sidebar.css, index.css
- Focus on integration and coordination, not new features

## Success Criteria
- HamburgerButton in Footer properly toggles Sidebar state
- All components use consistent CSS variables from index.css
- Mobile-first responsive design maintained
- Accessibility features work correctly
- Smooth transitions and proper z-index layering
