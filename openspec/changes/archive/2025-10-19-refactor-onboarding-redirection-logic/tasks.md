# Tasks: Refactor Onboarding Status Control and Redirection Logic

## Task 1: Enhance onboardingService.js with Centralized Methods ✅
- [x] Add `getOnboardingStatusWithCache()` method for cached status checking
- [x] Add `checkAndHandleRedirect()` method that combines checking and clearing
- [x] Add `setupRealtimeRedirectListener()` method for real-time updates
- [x] Add proper error handling and logging to all new methods
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing method signatures

## Task 2: Update AuthContext.jsx to Use Centralized Service ✅
- [x] Replace `fetchOnboardingStatus()` with calls to `onboardingService.getOnboardingStatus()`
- [x] Remove duplicate database query logic
- [x] Ensure onboardingCompleted state is populated from service
- [x] Test that AuthContext initialization still works correctly
- [x] Verify error handling is preserved

## Task 3: Refactor useAutoRedirect.js to Wrapper Pattern ✅
- [x] Replace direct database queries with `onboardingService.checkAndHandleRedirect()`
- [x] Replace Supabase channel setup with `onboardingService.setupRealtimeRedirectListener()`
- [x] Simplify the hook to only handle React-specific concerns (state, effects)
- [x] Preserve existing notification behavior and user experience
- [x] Test that real-time notifications still work

## Task 4: Update onboardingService.js Redirect Methods ✅
- [x] Merge `checkRedirectNeeded()` functionality into `checkAndHandleRedirect()`
- [x] Ensure `clearRedirectFlag()` is called automatically when handling redirects
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for redirect operations
- [x] Maintain existing return value formats for compatibility
- [x] Test all redirect scenarios (manual check, real-time, flag clearing)

## Task 5: Validate ProtectedRoute.jsx Integration ✅
- [x] Verify ProtectedRoute still correctly reads onboardingCompleted from AuthContext
- [x] Test redirection to onboarding when status is false
- [x] Test access to protected routes when status is true
- [x] Ensure no changes needed to ProtectedRoute logic
- [x] Confirm all authentication flows work as expected

## Task 6: Comprehensive Testing and Cleanup ✅
- [x] Test complete onboarding flow from login to home access
- [x] Test redirect notification flow after approval
- [x] Verify real-time updates work correctly
- [x] Remove any remaining duplicate code or unused methods
- [x] Add proper error logging throughout the refactored code
- [x] Validate performance improvements (reduced database queries)

## Task 7: Documentation and Validation ✅
- [x] Update code comments to reflect new centralized architecture
- [x] Validate that all existing functionality is preserved
- [x] Test edge cases (network errors, missing data, concurrent updates)
- [x] Ensure no breaking changes to existing API contracts
- [x] Run final integration tests for complete user flows
