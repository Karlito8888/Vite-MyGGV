# User Interface Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dynamic Header Content Display
The header SHALL display different content based on user authentication state, showing branding for unauthenticated users and message carousel for authenticated users.
#### Scenario:
When a user visits the application without being authenticated, the header SHALL display the GGV logo and "MyGGV" heading. When the user is authenticated, the header SHALL display an infinite carousel of messages from the messages_header table.

### Requirement: Infinite Loop Message Carousel
The message carousel SHALL continuously loop through all active messages without interruption when displayed to authenticated users.
#### Scenario:
When an authenticated user views the header, the message carousel SHALL continuously loop through all active messages without interruption, displaying each message for a configurable duration before transitioning to the next.

### Requirement: Authentication State Detection
The Header component SHALL detect authentication state and conditionally render appropriate content using the useAuth hook.
#### Scenario:
When the Header component renders, it SHALL detect the current authentication state using the useAuth hook and conditionally render either the branding content (logo + h1) or the message carousel.

### Requirement: Message Data Integration
The carousel SHALL fetch and display active messages from the database using the existing messagesHeaderService.
#### Scenario:
When the carousel is displayed, it SHALL fetch active messages using the listActiveHeaderMessages service and display them in the order returned by the database (most recent first).

### Requirement: Responsive Carousel Behavior
The carousel SHALL maintain proper functionality and readability across all screen sizes with mobile-first responsive design.
#### Scenario:
When the carousel is viewed on different screen sizes, it SHALL maintain readability and proper functionality, adjusting text size and animation speed as needed for mobile devices.

### Requirement: Error Handling for Message Display
The carousel SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback content when message fetching fails or no messages are available.
#### Scenario:
When message fetching fails or no messages are available, the carousel SHALL display appropriate fallback content and maintain the header's visual consistency.

### Requirement: Smooth State Transitions
The header SHALL provide smooth visual transitions when switching between authentication states without layout shifts or glitches.
#### Scenario:
When a user logs in or out, the header SHALL smoothly transition between branding content and carousel display without visual glitches or layout shifts.

## MODIFIED Requirements
