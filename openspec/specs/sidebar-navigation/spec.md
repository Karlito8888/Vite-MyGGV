# Sidebar Navigation Specification

## Purpose
Provide a mobile-friendly collapsible sidebar navigation system with hamburger button toggle to improve screen space utilization and user experience on mobile devices.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Hamburger Button Toggle
The application SHALL provide a hamburger button in the header for authenticated users to access the navigation menu.

#### Scenario:
When I am viewing any page as a logged-in user, I want to see a hamburger button in the header so that I can access the navigation menu.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Hamburger button is visible in header for authenticated users
- Button uses standard hamburger icon (three horizontal lines)
- Button is positioned on the left side of header
- Button is accessible with proper ARIA labels
- Button has hover and active states

### Requirement: Collapsible Sidebar
The application SHALL provide a collapsible sidebar that slides in from the left side of the screen when the hamburger button is clicked using JavaScript-controlled animations.

#### Scenario:
When I click the hamburger button, I want a sidebar to slide in smoothly from the left side of the screen using JavaScript animations so that I can see all navigation options with consistent timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Sidebar slides in smoothly using JavaScript-controlled transforms
- Sidebar animation timing is consistent (300ms duration)
- Sidebar contains the existing Navigation component
- Sidebar has a close button (X) in the top-right corner
- Sidebar width is appropriate for mobile devices (280-300px)
- Sidebar has proper z-index to appear above content
- No CSS animations are used for sidebar movement

### Requirement: Backdrop Overlay
The application SHALL provide a backdrop overlay when the sidebar is open using JavaScript-controlled animations for consistent behavior.

#### Scenario:
When the sidebar is open, I want the main content to be dimmed with an overlay using JavaScript animations so that I can focus on the navigation with smooth transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Dark overlay appears when sidebar is open using JavaScript fade-in
- Overlay covers entire viewport
- Clicking overlay closes the sidebar
- Overlay has semi-transparent background
- Overlay prevents interaction with main content
- Overlay animation timing matches sidebar animation (300ms)

### Requirement: Navigation Integration
The application SHALL integrate the existing Navigation component within the sidebar without duplicating functionality.

#### Scenario:
When the sidebar is open, I want to see all the navigation links that are normally in the Navigation component so that I can navigate to any page.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- All existing navigation links are present in sidebar
- Navigation links maintain their styling and functionality
- Active page highlighting works correctly
- External links (like GPS) open in new tabs
- Navigation component is not duplicated elsewhere when sidebar is open

### Requirement: Close Functionality
The application SHALL provide multiple ways to close the sidebar including automatic closure when navigation links are clicked.

#### Scenario:
When I want to close the sidebar, I want multiple ways to do it including clicking navigation links so that I can easily return to the main content after navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Clicking close button (X) closes sidebar with JavaScript animation
- Clicking overlay backdrop closes sidebar with JavaScript animation
- Pressing Escape key closes sidebar with JavaScript animation
- Clicking any navigation link closes sidebar with JavaScript animation
- Sidebar slides out smoothly to the left using JavaScript transforms
- State is properly managed to prevent memory leaks
- All close methods use consistent animation timing (300ms)

### Requirement: Mobile-First Responsive Design
The application SHALL ensure the sidebar works appropriately across different screen sizes with a mobile-first approach.

#### Scenario:
When I view the application on different screen sizes, I want the sidebar to work appropriately so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Sidebar works on mobile devices (320px and up)
- Sidebar is hidden by default on all screen sizes
- Smooth animations work on mobile devices
- Touch interactions work properly on mobile
- No horizontal scroll is introduced

### Requirement: Header Layout
The header SHALL accommodate the hamburger button without breaking existing functionality.

#### Scenario:
When the hamburger button is added to the header, I want the existing header content to remain functional so that no current features are broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Header logo and messages continue to work
- Hamburger button is positioned without breaking layout
- Header remains responsive on all screen sizes
- Existing header styling is preserved
- No conflicts with theme toggle functionality

### Requirement: Layout Structure
The overall application layout SHALL remain stable when integrating the sidebar functionality.

#### Scenario:
When the sidebar is integrated into the layout, I want the overall app structure to remain stable so that the application continues to work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Main content area remains accessible
- Footer continues to appear at bottom
- No layout shifts when sidebar opens/closes
- Proper z-index layering prevents overlap issues
- Scroll behavior is maintained

### Requirement: Navigation Link Auto-Close
The application SHALL automatically close the sidebar when any navigation link is clicked to improve user experience.

#### Scenario:
When I click on any navigation link in the sidebar, I want the sidebar to automatically close so that I can immediately see the content I navigated to without manual sidebar closure.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- All internal navigation links trigger sidebar closure on click
- External links (like GPS) also trigger sidebar closure on click
- Sidebar closure animation is smooth and consistent
- Navigation functionality remains unchanged
- Auto-close works for both internal and external links
- Sidebar closes before or during page navigation

### Requirement: CSS Organization and Specificity
The sidebar navigation CSS SHALL use consistent `.sidebar-navigation` prefix for all sub-components and merge duplicate selectors to improve maintainability.

#### Scenario: CSS Selector Consistency
- **WHEN** viewing the Sidebar.css file
- **THEN** all navigation-related selectors SHALL have `.sidebar-navigation` prefix
- **AND** similar selectors SHALL be merged to reduce duplication

#### Scenario: Preserved Functionality
- **WHEN** the CSS refactoring is applied
- **THEN** all existing sidebar functionality SHALL remain unchanged
- **AND** responsive design SHALL work across all breakpoints
- **AND** theme support SHALL be preserved
- **AND** touch interactions SHALL continue to work properly

#### Scenario: Improved Maintainability
- **WHEN** developers work with the CSS
- **THEN** selector specificity SHALL be consistent
- **AND** code duplication SHALL be reduced
- **AND** CSS organization SHALL be clearer
